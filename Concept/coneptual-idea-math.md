In classical physics, time is asymmetric—entropy increases, and processes are irreversible. But in quantum mechanics:

The Schrödinger equation is time-symmetric.

Quantum systems can evolve forward and backward without violating physical laws.

This opens the door to bidirectional measurement, where both 
$$𝑡
 and 
−
𝑡$$
 are used to reconstruct a fuller picture of quantum behavior.

🧮 Mathematical Framework
1. Wavefunction Evolution
Let 
$$𝜓
(
𝑥
,
𝑡
)$$
 be the wavefunction at time 
$$𝑡$$
. Its evolution is governed by:

$$𝑖
ℏ
∂
𝜓
(
𝑥
,
𝑡
)
∂
𝑡
=
𝐻
^
𝜓
(
𝑥
,
𝑡
)$$
For inverse time:

𝜓
(
𝑥
,
−
𝑡
)
=
𝑈
†
(
𝑡
)
𝜓
(
𝑥
,
0
)
where 
𝑈
†
(
𝑡
)
 is the adjoint of the time evolution operator.

2. Bidirectional Observable Mapping
Define a bidirectional observable 
𝑂
^
bi
 as:

⟨
𝑂
^
bi
⟩
=
1
2
[
⟨
𝜓
(
𝑡
)
∣
𝑂
^
∣
𝜓
(
𝑡
)
⟩
+
⟨
𝜓
(
−
𝑡
)
∣
𝑂
^
∣
𝜓
(
−
𝑡
)
⟩
]
This averages the observable across both time directions, revealing symmetry or asymmetry in evolution.

3. Bidirectional Entanglement Entropy
Track entanglement entropy forward and backward:

𝑆
bi
=
1
2
[
−
Tr
(
𝜌
(
𝑡
)
log
⁡
𝜌
(
𝑡
)
)
−
Tr
(
𝜌
(
−
𝑡
)
log
⁡
𝜌
(
−
𝑡
)
)
]
This exposes how quantum connectivity evolves and dissolves across time.

4. Fluctuation Mapping
Let 
𝑓
(
𝑡
)
 be a fluctuation function (e.g., in energy or position). Then:

𝐹
bi
(
𝑡
)
=
𝑓
(
𝑡
)
−
𝑓
(
−
𝑡
)
This measures asymmetry in fluctuations, which may signal decoherence, entropy flow, or hidden dynamics.
