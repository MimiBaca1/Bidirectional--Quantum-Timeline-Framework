## Conceptual Foundation
In classical physics, time is asymmetric—entropy increases, and processes are irreversible. But in quantum mechanics:

The Schrödinger equation is time-symmetric.

Quantum systems can evolve forward and backward without violating physical laws.

This opens the door to bidirectional measurement, where both 
$$𝑡
 and 
−
𝑡$$
 are used to reconstruct a fuller picture of quantum behavior.

## Quantum Bidirectional Timeline Framework
This framework models quantum particle behavior using both forward time (t) and inverse time (-t) to capture fluctuations, entanglement, and observable dynamics across a bidirectional timeline.

1. Wavefunction Evolution
Forward Time: $$ i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi(x, t)}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi(x, t) $$

Inverse Time: $$ \psi(x, -t) = U^\dagger(t) \psi(x, 0) $$

2. Bidirectional Observable Expectation
Average observable across both time directions: $$ \langle \hat{O}_{\text{bi}} \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \langle \psi(t) | \hat{O} | \psi(t) \rangle + \langle \psi(-t) | \hat{O} | \psi(-t) \rangle \right] $$

3. Bidirectional Entanglement Entropy
Tracks quantum connectivity forward and backward: $$ S_{\text{bi}} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ -\text{Tr}(\rho(t) \log \rho(t)) - \text{Tr}(\rho(-t) \log \rho(-t)) \right] $$

4. Fluctuation Asymmetry Function
Measures directional imbalance in quantum fluctuations: $$ F_{\text{bi}}(t) = f(t) - f(-t) $$


5. Fibonacci Time Sampling
Models quasiperiodic fluctuation propagation from a central singularity: $$ t_n = t_0 + F_n \cdot \delta t,\quad -t_n = t_0 - F_n \cdot \delta t $$

Where:

𝐹
𝑛
 is the 
𝑛
-th Fibonacci number

𝛿
𝑡
 is the time increment

𝑡
0
 is the central reference time
