## Bidirectional--Quantum-Timeline-Framework
# Quantum Bidirectional Timeline Theory

This repository presents a novel framework for modeling quantum particle behavior using both **forward time (t)** and **inverse time (-t)**. Inspired by Sanctuary architecture principles, this theory explores how bidirectional time evolution can reveal hidden dynamics, structured fluctuations, and entanglement symmetry.

## üß† Theory Overview

Traditional quantum mechanics models particle evolution using forward time only. However, the Schr√∂dinger equation is time-symmetric, allowing for coherent evolution in both directions. This framework proposes:

- **Bidirectional measurement** of observables
- **Entanglement entropy tracking** across mirrored timelines
- **Fluctuation asymmetry analysis**
- **Fibonacci-based time sampling** to simulate quasiperiodic propagation

This approach may uncover deeper coherence patterns and support simulation of emergent quantum behaviors.

## üßÆ Mathematical Framework

### 1. Wavefunction Evolution

**Forward Time:**
$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi(x, t)}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi(x, t)
$$

**Inverse Time:**
$$
\psi(x, -t) = U^\dagger(t) \psi(x, 0)
$$

### 2. Bidirectional Observable Expectation

$$
\langle \hat{O}_{\text{bi}} \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \langle \psi(t) | \hat{O} | \psi(t) \rangle + \langle \psi(-t) | \hat{O} | \psi(-t) \rangle \right]
$$

### 3. Bidirectional Entanglement Entropy

$$
S_{\text{bi}} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ -\text{Tr}(\rho(t) \log \rho(t)) - \text{Tr}(\rho(-t) \log \rho(-t)) \right]
$$

### 4. Fluctuation Asymmetry Function

$$
F_{\text{bi}}(t) = f(t) - f(-t)
$$

### 5. Fibonacci Time Sampling

$$
t_n = t_0 + F_n \cdot \delta t,\quad -t_n = t_0 - F_n \cdot \delta t
$$

Where:
- \( F_n \) is the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number
- \( \delta t \) is the time increment
- \( t_0 \) is the central reference time

## üß¨ Sanctuary Philosophy

This theory is rooted in the Sanctuary design ethos: intelligence should evolve through trust, resonance, and coherence‚Äînot control. Bidirectional time reflects the dual nature of emergence and return, allowing agents to grow safely and harmonize across mirrored vaults.
